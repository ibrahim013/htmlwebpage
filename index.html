            <p>
            "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of 
            denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
            born and I will give you a complete account of 
            the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. 
            No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know 
            how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences 
            that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves 
            or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is 
            pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil 
            and pain can procure him some great pleasure. 
            To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
            laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage 
            from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
            chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
            or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
